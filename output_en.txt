 Would you buy a human? Well, it's possible. This person, 13 years ago, Mike, did the craziest thing. He decided to sell himself to other people online. He divided his life into shares, just like companies do in the stock market. And when people buy a share, they get to vote on Mike's life decisions. They vote on what he wears every day, whether he should get a new job. They said no. Or Mary, his girlfriend. They said yes. Or become a Republican. They couldn't say no. Whatever the shareholders decide, Mike tries his absolute best to respect him. He believes in capitalism so much that he found more than a thousand people to buy his life. This is Mike's life. And I guess he is free to do whatever he wants with it. That's one minute. See you tomorrow.
